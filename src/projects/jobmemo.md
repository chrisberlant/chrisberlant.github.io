Help users track their various job applications and their associated contacts.
It includes authentication, creating/reading/updating/deleting job offers and contacts.  
The main feature is the cards drag and drop.  
A trash bin allows the user to drag cards inside and restore them later if needed, or delete them permanently, just like on a desktop environment.
