This internal webapp allows a team to manage a stock of
various mobile devices (basic phones, smartphones, 4G
modems).  
It includes authentication,
creating/reading/updating/deleting multiple elements, and
CSV files import/export.  
An admin dashboard allows users with the required role to do
things like see the actions history and create new users
allowed to access the app.  
You can find the full documentation on the repositories.
