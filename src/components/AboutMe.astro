			About me
		</h2>

		<div>
			<p class='mt-1'>
				After working for 10 years in IT as a VIP support, I decided to
				get back into the development world, which I firstly started
				diving into during my free time in 2004, then during my studies
				in 2010.
			</p>
			<p class='mt-1'>
				To achieve this, I followed the{' '}
				<a href='https://oclock.io' target='_blank'> O'clock school </a>
				's six months intensive program focused on learning how to code using
				the JavaScript language with solo & group projects, sometimes using
				pair programming, and built projects on my own.
			</p>
			<p class='mt-1'>
				I love traveling, especially in Asian countries, and discovering
				new things, related or not to the IT domain.
